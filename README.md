# Pharmacy Management System
The `Pharmacy Management System` developed using [`Java Swing`](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jframe#:~:text=JFrame%20class%20is%20a%20type,of%20setDefaultCloseOperation(int)%20method.) and [`PostgreSQL`](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/) is a comprehensive software application that efficiently handles various tasks involved in managing a pharmacy. This integrated system combines the user-friendly graphical interface of Java Swing with the robust and scalable database capabilities of PostgreSQL. 

## Motivation

- `Efficiency and Productivity`: Traditional manual methods of managing pharmacy operations can be time-consuming and prone to errors. A Pharmacy Management System automates tasks like inventory management, billing, and prescription tracking, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. This allows pharmacy staff to focus more on providing quality patient care.
- `Accurate Inventory Management`: Maintaining accurate inventory records is crucial for a pharmacy. A management system helps track medicine stock levels, expiration dates, and supplier information. With real-time updates, pharmacists can prevent stockouts and avoid overstocking, leading to cost savings and improved customer service.
- `Streamlined Billing and Sales`: The system automates the billing process, generating accurate invoices for customers. It calculates the total cost, applies taxes and discounts, and updates the inventory accordingly. This streamlines the sales process and minimizes errors in billing.
- `Business Insights`: The system generates reports and analytics, providing valuable insights into business performance, popular medications, and sales trends. This data-driven approach helps pharmacy owners make informed decisions and adapt their strategies accordingly.
- `Data Security and Backup`: By using a reliable database system like PostgreSQL, the pharmacy's data is kept secure and can be regularly backed up to prevent data loss due to hardware failures or other unforeseen circumstances.

## Installation
- Work In Progress
  
## Key Features 
- `User-friendly Interface`: The system boasts an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface, enabling easy navigation and interaction with the application.
- Login and Authentication: It provides a secure login system to restrict access to authorized personnel only. Different user roles, such as pharmacist, store manager, or cashier, may have different levels of access and permissions.
- `Medicine Inventory Management`: The system keeps track of the pharmacy's medicine inventory, including details like name, quantity, batch number, expiration date, and supplier information. It provides alerts when stock levels are low to avoid running out of critical medications.
- `Sales and Billing`: The system facilitates the billing process by generating invoices for customers based on their purchases. It calculates the total cost, including taxes and discounts, if applicable.
- `Prescription Handling`: The system stores and manages prescription information, enabling easy retrieval and tracking of patient medication history.
